==========================

This project is designed to get a new grid up and running quickly so you can
start testing!

The grid-test subdirectory is pretty self-explanatory:

Put the HUB directory on your hub (if your hub is a windows box, you'll need to
rename the executable 'starthub' to something like 'starthub.cmd' and fix the
link).

 - Put the appropriate *-node directory/ies on your node/s along with the 
   selenium-server-standalone-2.43.1.jar (or whichever version you're using... but
   if you change it, change the links in the startup scripts to match).

 - Update the JSON configs with the ip of your hub and the ip of each of your
   nodes.

 - Run ./starthub on the hub
 - Run ./startnode-* on your nodes

 - Done.  You have a grid.  You can check the connections from your browser at 
   http://localhost:4444/grid/console on your hub machine.


The grid-test directory contains a little startup test, too!

Edit the RemoteTest.java file and update your email login info, or you'll get
an exception (and no mail) after the test is done.

 - For the grid-test to work you'll need maven:  run 'mvn clean install' from
   the grid-test directory.
 - Edit helpers/isgridup.sh with your correct path info.
 - Edit src/main/resources/testng-grid.xml and enter your hub ip address.
 - If you're on a windows box, change isgridup.sh to isgridup.cmd or something.
 - Run helpers/isgridup.sh, and you should see your nodes all navigate to the QAV
   website.


This should get you up and running and building tests quickly on your new grid.


A few more notes:

The grid tries to be smart about where it runs tests.  It will check the
os-list parameter defined in the testng-grid.xml first for which OSes you'd
like to test on, then cross-references that with the attributes of the nodes
that are actually connected to the hub.  So if there are nodes connected to the
hub that aren't in the os-list, they won't get tests run on them.  

I didn't implement the same cross-reference for browsers - the grid will
attempt to run tests on all browsers registered from the node.

RemoteTest.java also includes functionality that will send a screenshot via
email.  You can extend BaseTestListener to call RemoteTest::screenShot() on a
failure.  Caveat:  you might need to introduce a wait state there - Selenium
is so fast that occasionally the screen is gone before it can be snapped.

ENJOY!
